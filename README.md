# alien_invasion_game
Hobby project, initial Idea based on Python Crash Course Third Edition by Eric Matthes

In this game the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
The player can control the ship using the left an right arrow keys and shoot bullets using the space bar.
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fillsthe sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three shipts, the game ends.
